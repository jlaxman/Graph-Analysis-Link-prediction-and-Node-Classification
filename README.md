# Graph-Analysis-Link-prediction-and-Node-Classification
As part of CS550 Massive Data Mining Course

This project aims to explore different methods of performing node classification and link prediction using the CORA graph dataset. Specifically, we compare the performance of GraphSAGE and GCN models on this dataset, and also examine the mathematical foundations of these networks.
